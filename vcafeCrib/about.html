                        Video games have become popular over the year and their popularity can best be 
                        described by fact that in 2016 the video game industry's revenue was more than 
                        that of the music and movie industry combined with the total revenue being $23.5 
                        billion dollars. The rise of the video-gaming market has been exponential over 
                        they years but still the idea of gaming Is far to expensive for some people 
                        and is also not convenient because video games lose their value after a certain 
                        amount of time. Taking these issues to account V-café crib a video game and coffee 
                        shop hybrid will offer an enjoyable experience with the latest and greatest games 
                        at the best value possible. The café part of our store will allow us to sell customers 
                        our coffee, energy drinks and snacks which will help our customers feel more comfortable 
                        and thus they will have an enjoyable experience. The store will focus on its videogame 
                        side more but if people want to just by coffee and snacks like a regular café, they will
                         be able to do that as well. V-café crib will be packed with the latest video game 
                         technologies such as high-power gaming computers, PS4, Xbox one and the Nintendo switch.
                          V-café crib will charge it customers by various ways such as having a yearly subscription,
                           hourly subscription or special discounts for professional gaming teams. 
                           The hourly charge will allow you to play the games at the store (different amount may apply 
                           depending on the gaming platform), but the catch will be that they will have to buy 
                           something at the café: this practice will be in charge to ensure that the gaming part of 
                           the store does not take over the café part to much. The different drawback of buying an 
                           hourly subscription will not be there if you buy a yearly subscription which will ensure you 
                           access to all the games and you will not have to buy and order food or coffee.
                            In conclusion V-café crib will offer an enjoyable experience,
                         good food and top of the line gaming equipment at the best price possible.
